## ⚙️ Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get secureChat v2 up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm or Yarn package manager
*   Git

### Step-by-Step Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Pantkartik/Cypher_Chat_version_2.git
    cd Cypher_Chat_version_2
    ```

2.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**

    Navigate into the `Backend` directory and install its dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd Backend
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Configure Backend Environment (Optional):**

    If your backend requires specific environment variables (e.g., for database connection, secret keys), create a `.env` file in the `Backend` directory based on a provided `.env.example` (if available).

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Open .env and configure your variables
    ```

4.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**

    Navigate into the `Frontend` directory and install its dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd ../Frontend # Go back to root, then enter Frontend
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

5.  **Start the Backend Server:**

    From the `Backend` directory, start the server:

    ```bash
    cd ../Backend
    npm start # or npm run dev if using a dev script
    ```
    The backend server will typically run on `http://localhost:3000` (or another port as configured).

6.  **Start the Frontend Application:**

    From the `Frontend` directory, launch the frontend:

    ```bash
    cd ../Frontend
    npm start # or npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend application will usually be accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port).

Your secureChat v2 application should now be running!


## 🚀 Usage Examples

Once installed, you can access the application through your web browser.

### Basic Interaction

1.  **Open in Browser:** Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or your configured frontend port) in your web browser.
2.  **Register/Login:** Create a new account or log in with existing credentials.
3.  **Start Chatting:** Begin a new conversation or join an existing one to experience real-time messaging.

### Example Code Snippet (Frontend Connection)

This is a conceptual example of how the frontend might connect to the backend WebSocket server:5

```typescript
// Frontend (e.g., in a JavaScript or TypeScript file)
import { io } from 'socket.io-client';

const socket = io('http://localhost:3000'); // Connect to your backend WebSocket server

socket.on('connect', () => {
  console.log('Connected to chat server!');
  // Emit a message
  socket.emit('sendMessage', {
    sender: 'Pantkartik',
    message: 'Hello, secureChat!',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
});

socket.on('receiveMessage', (data) => {
  console.log('New message:', data.message, 'from', data.sender);
  // Update UI with the new message
});

socket.on('disconnect', () => {
  console.log('Disconnected from chat server.');
});
```
